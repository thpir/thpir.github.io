                        My name is Thijs Pirmez and I'm a self-thought Android&trade; developer.
                        I currently work as a <em>"project-engineer"</em> in an <abbr title="Research & Development">R&D</abbr> team of a company active in the automotive industry.
                        It is my job to turn a <em>"concept"</em> into a <em>"product"</em>.
                        Prior to my work as a Project Engineer, I've been working in the wind industry as a service technician for wind turbines.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="markup-p">
                        I've always had a fascination for software development,
                        and am (ever since the Blackberry came to life) a huge enthousiast for Smartphones.
                        As a boy-scout I found the pocket knife a fascinating tool, it had so many functinonalities while still fitting in your pocket.
                        Well... I think smartphones are modern man's Swiss army knife.
                        When it comes to developing applications to make one's live easier, 
                        the possibilities are only limited by the developer's imagination!
                        This is what fascinates me so much.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="markup-p">
                        I didn't study software-engineering in college though.
                        Software-development has always been like a <em>"black-box"</em> for me.
                        It is only in 2021 that I started to explore the fascinating world of software engineering.
                        In August 2021, I found a tutorial online to create your first <em>"hello world!"</em> app in Android Studio.
                        In January 2022, I released my fist <em>"basic"</em> application on my <a href="https://github.com/thpir" target="_blank" class="inline_link">Github page</a>.
                        More information can be found <a href="https://github.com/thpir/Tic-Tac-Toe/releases/tag/Tic-Tac-Toe_v1.0" target="_blank" class="inline_link">here</a> .
                        Since then I've been spending as much time as I could spare (while raising three kids) to improve my skills as a developer.
                        I hope to call myself a professional android developer one day!

                                <p class="project-description">This is the first fully functional application I've every fully developed. 
                                    This project was also my first project after learing Java. 
                                    The application is a Tic-Tac-Toe game which can be played with a friend on one device, 
                                    or you can enable a single player mode and play against the application. 
                                    For a more personalized user experience I have added the possiblity to create a local 
                                    account so you can add your name to the leaderboard. For this project I also experimented with Lottifiles. 
                                    I used Lottifiles for a fireworks animation every time one of the players makes a point. 
                                    A release .apk version as well as the source code is available on my Github account.</p>

                                <p class="project-description">My Energy Desk is an energy meter logger tool designed for people who want to log and 
                                    monitor their energy consumption at home on a weekly, 
                                    monthly or yearly basis. There are four types of energy that you can keep track of: 
                                    electricity consumption, natural gas consumption, water consumption and grid injection 
                                    (energy generated at home and injected into the grid). 
                                    By entering your meter readings periodically, you will build a database containing your meter readings. 
                                    That data is used to build statistical graphs of your usage over the years. 
                                    After some time you will be able to know how your energy usage changes over the years, and be able to take action if needed. 
                                    The app is 100% free of charge, advertisement-free and you can export your database to Excel at any time! 
                                    The application can be downloaded from the play store. 
                                    This was the first time I have released an app on the Google play store. 
                                    This project was also a great exercise to learn to work with databases</p>
