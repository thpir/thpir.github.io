                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        My name is Thpir and I'm a self-thought Android&trade; developer.
                        I currently work as a <em>"project-engineer"</em> in an <abbr title="Research & Development">R&D</abbr> team of a company active in the automotive industry.
                        It is my job to turn a <em>"concept"</em> into a <em>"product"</em>.
                        Prior to my work as a Project Engineer, I've been working in the wind industry as a service technician for wind turbines.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've always had a fascination for software development,
                        and am (ever since the Blackberry came to life) a huge enthousiast for Smartphones.
                        As a boy-scout I found the pocket knife a fascinating tool, it had so many functinonalities while still fitting in your pocket.
                        Well... I think smartphones are modern man's pocket knife.
                        When it comes to developing applications to make one's live easier, the possibilities are endless.
                        This is what fascinates me so much.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I didn't study software-engineering in college though.
                        Software-development has always been like a <em>"black-box"</em> for me.
                        It is only in 2021 that I started to explore the fascinating world of software engineering.
                        In August 2021, I found a tutorial online to create your first <em>"hello world!"</em> app in Android Studio.
                        In January 2022, I released my fist <em>"basic"</em> application on my <a href="https://github.com/thpir" target="_blank" class="inline_link">Github page</a>.
                        More information can be found <a href="https://github.com/thpir/Tic-Tac-Toe/releases/tag/Tic-Tac-Toe_v1.0" target="_blank" class="inline_link">here</a> .
                        Since then I've been spending as much time as I could spare (while raising three kids) to improve my skills as a developer.
                        I hope to call myself a professional android developer one day!
